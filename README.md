# Jay's Top Modules
This project extends the [drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) by adding modules from the popular "Top modules" blog series on [Mediacurrent.com](Mediacurrent.com). Most of the instructions from that project [readme](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) apply here as well.

This project is meant as an educational tool that will save you time getting setup.

# Installing
The easiest way to get started is to install composer (if you haven't already) and run the following commandL

```composer create-project mediacurrent/mc_top_modules```

This will download Drupal core, recommended "Top modules" and their dependencies. Once that is done you can install Drupal as normal! Downloaded modules are disabled by default but you can enable then on the "Extend" page within the Drupal admin.
